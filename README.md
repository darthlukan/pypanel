## Description

> PyPanel is a lightweight panel/taskbar written in Python and C for X11 window
> managers.  It can be easily customized to match any desktop theme or taste.
> PyPanel works with EWMH compliant WMs.

> The panel displays currently running tasks/applications and can also be
> configured to display the current desktop name, date/time, a system tray
> (notification area) and application launcher.

> When the panel is minimized, either manually or by autohide, it can be restored
> by moving the mouse over the top or bottom of the screen where the panel was
> displayed prior to minimization.

> All image rendering (icons and background transparency/tinting) is handled by
> Imlib2.

> Mouse button events on panel objects are handled by the ~/.pypanelrc
> configuration file.  The file is a python script which gets imported/executed
> when PyPanel is invoked.  Ensure that it contains proper Python formatting and
> no syntax errors or the panel will not start!
